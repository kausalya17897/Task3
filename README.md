# Task3
3)Summary of what I have read:
   The most basic relationship among the three is that each browser tab has its own window,and a window has window.document and window.screen properties.The browser tabâ€™s window is the global context,so document and screen refer to window.document and window.screen.
window-is the execution context and global object for javascript.
document-contains DOM initialised by parsing HTML.
screen-describes the physical screen dimension.
